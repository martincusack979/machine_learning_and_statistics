# Machine Learning and Statistics

** Task 4 

*** The Iris data set is based on measurements taken from three different species of Iris flower: Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica.  There are four measurements provided for each sample of these species:  sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width.  One way of establishing whether the setosa class of Iris flower is easily separable from the other two classes is to train a machine learning algorithm (such as K Nearest Neighbours) so that it can make predictions on which class a data point belongs to based on the available information. We can then produce a visualisation to further illustrate whether the setosa class is in fact easily separable from the other two classes.

### Task 5

Perform Principal Component Analysis on the iris data set, reducing the number of dimensions to two. Explain the purpose
of the analysis and your results.

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a useful tool for interpreting and analysing multi-dimensional data, such as the Iris data set.  It can be used in conjunction with Seaborn to create 2-dimensional visualisations which allow us to determine the separability of the data. In this task we will take the four variables in the Iris data set (sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width) and using PCA we can reduce the dimensionality of the data and therefore gain a deeper understanding of the variables in the Iris data set.
