# Machine Learning and Statistics

by Martin Cusack

** Task 4 

*** The Iris data set is based on measurements taken from three different species of Iris flower: Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica.  There are four measurements provided for each sample of these species:  sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width.  One way of establishing whether the setosa class of Iris flower is easily seperable from the other two classes is to train a machine learning algorithm (such as K Nearest Neighbours) so that it can make predictions on which class a data point belongs to based on the available information. We can then produce a visualisation to further illustrate whether the setosa class is in fact easily seperable from the other two classes.
